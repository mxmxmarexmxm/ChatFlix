# ChatFlix

ChatFlix is a web application built with React, Firebase, and CSS modules, with authentication via Gmail. The app is designed to look and feel like NetFlix, but instead of movies, it is all about programming and related topics."

## Features

ChatFlix has different categories such as Frontend, Backend Frameworks, Learning Platforms, Code Editors, and Operating Systems. Each category has a set of related chats where you can discuss specific programming topics, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Udacity, Coursera, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, MacOS, and Linux.
